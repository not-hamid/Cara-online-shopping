### Note

This design was inspired by a YouTube tutorial playlist by [Tech2etc](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bD98LkBR7P8MYh0RzNSHgeVNTA8g0nB&si=Us7brKQt6bACkxO9). The website was crafted based on the material provided in the videos, using **Tailwind CSS**. I also added extra features and implemented some unique concepts and design elements.
